Python files:

* `main.py` - trains/loads the GAN model and display the results (optimized for CUDA and AWS operation)
* `gan.py` - object definitions for the GAN model and all three component networks (generator, projector, discriminator)
* `utils.py` - helper functions for data handling

Jupyter notebooks:

* `sandbox.ipynb` - trains/loads the GAN model and displays the results (visual tool for debugging and prototyping)
* `projector_training.ipynb` - trains/loads the projector model
